This app connects to IB via either IB Gateway or TWS and gets option data for
Foreign Exchange rates.

First, make sure you have downloaded Java and the most current version of JDK.

Next download and install TWS and IBgateway from:

http://individuals.interactivebrokers.com/en/main.php

It can be found under the trading tab.  It is easiest to set permanent aliases
in your .bashrc file to run TWS or IBgateway, as the command is rather lengthy

Next download the NetBeans IDE:

netbeans.org

To run the app, you must have TWS or IB gateway running.  You can either run it
from NetBeans or from the command line.

From NetBeans, right click on the GetData project and click on Properties.
Under the Run Tab, enter the 3-letter globex symbols for currencies you want
to retrieve separated by a space (EUR CAD)

To run the app from the command line:
cd into the APIRebuild/dist directory and run:
java -jar GetData.jar EUR CAD
or whatever currencies you want.
